# Create Data

Data creation requires an Endpoint configured, but also a Data Bundle selected (so configured first, with a data Named Graph, and an ontology one). Keep in mind that without having an ontology, Logre can not know what your data should have as properties, so in order to create entities with the interface, think of importing (or creating) an ontology first (see page “Import Data” for that).

Once you have imported and configured an ontology in your Data Bundle, you can use the “Create entity” button, which allows you to create entities (what a surprise) respecting the ontology (but only for outgoing properties! More on that later)
